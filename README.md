The intro repository
Stephen Narcisse here, write to myself and anyone who reads my git. At the stage of writing this I'm a CS student at KBCC in Brooklyn. I've felt a little lost up till
now in regards to what I'm going to be doing as a SWE. From now on I'll be actively coding for myself and learning things that actually matter. 5/16/2021
